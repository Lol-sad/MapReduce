Atypon’s flagship product is Literatum, which was released. It is a comprehensive publishing and website development platform that enables content providers to deliver, market, and sell any type of digital content as well as to control the user interface and user experience of their publication websites.
The company was founded in Silicon Valley by software engineer and Fulbright Scholar Georgios Papadopoulos, who had earlier pioneered the publication of scientific journals on the web.Papadopoulos remains Atypon’s chairman.

Atypon has grown both organically and through acquisitions. It acquired Extenza e-Publishing Services. The acquisition of eMeta expanded Atypon’s product portfolio to include RightSuite, an enterprise access and commerce platform for the publishing and media industry. Atypon acquired the Metapress business from EBSCO Online, with the Metapress platform to be discontinued and customers moved to Atypon's Literatum platform.

In October, Atypon was purchased by academic publisher John Wiley Sons for twenty million.Atypon now operates as a separate, independent business unit of Wiley. Wiley migrated its own Wiley Online Library to Literatum.
